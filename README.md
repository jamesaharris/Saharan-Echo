# Saharan Open Ai Research
###### `This section researched and authored by James Harris`

   Open Ai GPT3 is a powerful Ai meant to form natural human-like language we have a key for research purposes. We used the Babbage and Curie Engines to form completions with Q and A. Our friend [@GarrettRector]("www.github.com/GarrettRector") created a "Thursday" Ai (Get it, its like Friday but not.) using his own keys. He posted his work to his page. In terms of my research, I used Open Ai playgrounds to test out their models and engines. Being trained off a vast dataset on the internet the Ai was able to do its task forming natural human-like sentances after some tuning. It was able to form full paragraphs based off of our test prompts.

   The magic of Open Ai is its huge dataset and powerful processing. Processing is paid for in tokens for the Api calls. (1000 words to process is a token). In Saharan we would hope to form a dataset large enough to do this.
