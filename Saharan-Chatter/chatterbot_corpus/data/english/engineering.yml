conversations:
- - what's the expected tolerance for this crank pin?
  - it should be about 0.0005 milimeters 
- - how would the crank pin be designed
  - subtractive boolean operations 
  - - whats the design phase of the motor block
  - i've just finished and its now at the manufacturing facility for prototype testing
  - - speaking of prototype testing, how are we going to test the motor 
  - simple, we will just push the motor beyond what it was intended to do. such as increase the redline as far as possible and playing with ignition temperatures
  - - what is a boolean operation
    - a boolean operation are just simple words that can be used in models
    - such as and, which means to fuse 
    - not means to remove 
    - or means to remove a little 
    - and not means to take a sum 
  - - what is cad software
    - cad is computer aided design
    - it is just a software that you can design objects that would be hard to do on paper
    - also you can make far more complex designs and test them instantly 
  - - how is engineering aplicable in real life
    - everything that was made by a human, or that was made by a robot was designed by an engineer
    - engineers are the only reason that we are not in cave man times
    - even simple things like a chair or a ball was designed by an engineer
