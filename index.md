# Welcome to the Saharan Echo Project
###### Research by James Harris and David Dodita hosted on Github

The Saharan Echo Project is a project with the purposes of documenting and researching how different AIs work in the wild that we find interesting. Then taking our findings to create our own AI to detect human's emotions, tone, and be able to read and respond to them effectively. 

We are both just teens interested in Computer Sciences and Engineering hoping to build our collage portfolios. We are working with thrid party AI's such as Chatter bot and Open AI GPT 2 (Hoping to get 3 *hint Open AI **hint***).
