# Saharan Chatter
###### `This section researched and authored by James Harris`
This is the chatterbot portion of our research. It is currently being trained with as much data as possible to create a complete set for a voice and text bot. It is not a personal assistant, it is more along the lines of a cleverbot type thing without the weird stuff the internet threw at it. 

We resued [@jamesaharris's Will and Gill Bots](https://www.github.com/jamesaharris/will-and-gill)  to test our dictionaries, They had the same results as the last time, just with a little bit more annoyance from our custom dictionaries not fully working. We were not able to implement our engineering conversations dictionary for some unknown reason. It would not work right and we don't feel like fixing it for the sake of our experiment.
